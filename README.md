A modern mobile application for managing and attending conventions, built with React Native and Expo. This project aims to provide attendees and organizers with a seamless experience for schedules, announcements, and event participation.

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

# Convention App Client

A modern mobile application for managing and attending conventions, built with React Native and Expo. This project aims to provide attendees and organizers with a seamless experience for schedules, announcements, and event participation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/convention-app-client.git
   cd convention-app-client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

- To run on Android:
  ```sh
  npm run android
  ```
- To run on iOS:
  ```sh
  npm run ios
  ```
- To run on web:
  ```sh
  npm run web
  ```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file at the project root to configure API endpoints and other environment-specific settings. Example:

```env
API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
```

You can access these variables in your code using [expo-constants](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/constants/) or a library like [`react-native-dotenv`](https://github.com/goatandsheep/react-native-dotenv).

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend via REST APIs. Use `fetch` or `axios` to make requests to the backend endpoints defined in your `.env` file.

Example usage with `axios`:

```js
import axios from 'axios';

const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.API_URL,
});

export async function fetchEvents() {
  const response = await api.get('/events');
  return response.data;
}
```

## API Client Setup

This project uses [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for HTTP requests.

If you see errors like:
> Cannot find module 'axios' or its corresponding type declarations

Install axios and its types:

```sh
npm install axios
npm install --save-dev @types/axios
```

If you use TypeScript >=4.9, @types/axios may not be needed as axios ships its own types.

## Deployment

### Frontend

- The Expo/React Native frontend can be deployed using [Expo Application Services (EAS)](https://expo.dev/eas), Vercel, or Netlify for web builds.
- See [Expo deployment docs](https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/introduction/) for details.
- Environment variables are managed via `.env` files and `app.json`'s `extra` field.

### Backend

- The backend (in `/backend`) can be deployed to Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean, or any cloud/VPS provider.
- Ensure environment variables (e.g., `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`) are set securely in your deployment environment.
- See `/backend/README.md` for backend deployment instructions.

### CI/CD

- GitHub Actions workflows are set up for build, test, and deploy for both frontend and backend.
- Secrets and environment variables for CI/CD should be configured in your repository settings.

## Running Locally with Docker

You have two main options:

### 1. Using Docker Compose (Recommended for Full Stack)

This will start the frontend, backend, and MongoDB together:

```sh
./start.sh
```
or
```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

### 2. Building and Running the Frontend Dockerfile Directly

If you only want to run the frontend container:

```sh
docker build -t convention-frontend .
docker run -p 8081:8081 -p 19000:19000 -p 19001:19001 -p 19002:19002 convention-frontend
```

> **Note:**  
> The frontend expects the backend and MongoDB to be running and accessible at the URLs specified in your `.env` or Docker Compose configuration.  
> For a fully working environment, use Docker Compose as described above.

## Known Warnings and Errors

### MongoDB WiredTiger Checkpointer

You may see logs like:
```
[...]
```

These are normal warnings from MongoDB's WiredTiger storage engine. They can be safely ignored unless you experience actual data access issues.
