# Docker vs Kubernetes

## What is Docker?

- Docker is like a shipping container for your applications.
- It packages your code, libraries, and dependencies.
- This ensures consistent execution across environments.
- Simple to use for single-application deployments.

## What is Kubernetes?

- Kubernetes is like a sophisticated port authority.
- It manages and orchestrates a fleet of Docker containers.
- Handles scaling, load balancing, and high availability.
- Perfect for complex, microservice-based applications.

## Key Differences

- **Simplicity:** Docker is straightforward. Kubernetes is complex.
- **Scope:** Docker handles single containers. Kubernetes orchestrates many.
- **Scale:** Docker scales simply. Kubernetes scales massively.
- **Automation:** Docker offers basic automation. Kubernetes provides advanced automation.

## When to Use Docker

- Small projects.
- Single applications.
- Simple deployments.
- Learning containerization.

## When to Use Kubernetes

- Large-scale applications.
- Microservice architectures.
- Complex deployments.
- High availability and scalability needs.
