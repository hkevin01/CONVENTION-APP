# Constants Directory

This directory contains global constants used throughout the application. These include:

- API URLs and endpoints
- Theme values (colors, spacing, typography)
- App-wide configuration

## Organizing Constants

- Group related constants in their own files
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Export everything with named exports, not default exports
- Prefer using TypeScript enums or objects with readonly properties

## Files

- `Api.ts` - API endpoints and configuration
- `Colors.ts` - Color palette and theme values
- `Layout.ts` - Layout constants (spacing, dimensions)
- `Typography.ts` - Font families, sizes, weights
