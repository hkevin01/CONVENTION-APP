# Focus Guide for Copilot

## Project Overview
This project is a modernized version of an older codebase. The goal is to restructure, update, and document the project to meet current best practices.

## Key Objectives
1. Restructure the project into a clean and modular directory structure.
2. Update code to modern standards (e.g., ES6+ for JavaScript, Python 3.x for Python).
3. Provide detailed documentation in `README.md`, `WORKFLOW.md`, and `PROJECT_GOALS.md`.
4. Integrate automation tools like CI/CD pipelines and add necessary configuration files.

## Guidelines for Copilot
- Focus on maintaining readability and modularity in the code.
- Prioritize modern coding standards and remove deprecated practices.
- Ensure all changes are well-documented and tested.

## Useful Notes
- Use `.github` for workflows, templates, and GitHub-specific files.
- Use `.editorconfig`, `.prettierrc`, `.eslintrc` for consistency in code formatting.
- Add a `tests` folder with unit and integration tests.
