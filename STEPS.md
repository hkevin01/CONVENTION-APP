# Steps to a Fully Runnable Convention App

## What Has Been Done

- **Project Structure:**  
  - Modular directory structure with `src`, `docs`, `.github`, `.copilot`, etc.
  - Placeholder files for hooks, components, constants, and app routes.
  - Documentation: `README.md`, `WORKFLOW.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and more.
  - Configuration: `.editorconfig`, `.gitignore`, `.prettierrc`, `.eslintrc.json`, `babel.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `app.json`.
  - CI/CD: GitHub Actions workflows for build, test, and deploy.
  - Copilot guidance and prompts.

- **Frontend (React Native/Expo):**
  - All main folders and files for a React Native Expo app are scaffolded.
  - Components, hooks, and constants directories are present but empty.
  - Routing structure under `src/app` is set up for Expo Router.
  - Assets directory is assumed to be at the project root.

## What Still Needs To Be Done

### 1. **Frontend Implementation**
- Implement actual code in:
  - `src/components/` (UI components)
  - `src/hooks/` (custom hooks)
  - `src/constants/` (app constants, colors, etc.)
  - `src/app/` (screens, navigation, business logic)
- Add real assets (images, fonts) to the `assets` directory.
- Add tests in `src/components/__tests__/` and `src/app/__tests__/`.
- Implement error handling and loading states in UI.
- Add accessibility features (labels, roles, color contrast).
- Optimize performance (lazy loading, memoization, etc.).
- Add analytics and logging if needed.

### 2. **Backend/API**
- **A backend is required** for features like user authentication, event schedules, announcements, and data persistence.
- You can use Node.js/Express, Python/FastAPI, or any backend framework.
- The backend should provide REST or GraphQL APIs for:
  - User registration/login
  - Convention/event data (sessions, speakers, schedules)
  - Announcements and notifications
  - User profiles and preferences
  - Ticketing or check-in (if needed)
- **Add a new folder, e.g., `server/` or `backend/`, for backend code.**
- **Implement authentication (JWT, OAuth, etc.).**
- **Add database integration (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).**
- **Write unit and integration tests for backend endpoints.**
- **Add API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI or GraphQL schema).**
- **Implement rate limiting and security best practices (CORS, helmet, input validation).**
- **Recommended structure:**  
  - `backend/server.js` (Express/FastAPI entry point)
  - `backend/src/routes/` (API route handlers)
  - `backend/src/models/` (database models)
  - `backend/tests/` (unit/integration tests)
  - `backend/docs/` (API documentation)

### 3. **Integration**
- **Connect the frontend to the backend APIs** (using fetch, axios, or urql/apollo for GraphQL).
- **Add environment variable support for API endpoints.**
- **Implement authentication flows** (login, logout, token refresh).
- **Handle API errors and display user-friendly messages.**
- **Add optimistic UI updates where appropriate.**
- **Use TypeScript types/interfaces for API responses.**

### 4. **Deployment**
- Set up deployment for both frontend (Expo/React Native) and backend (cloud, VPS, or serverless).
- Update CI/CD workflows to include backend build/test/deploy.
- Ensure environment variables and secrets are managed securely for both frontend and backend.
- Document deployment steps for both parts of the codebase in the `docs/` directory.
- Consider using services like Vercel, Netlify, or Expo Application Services for frontend, and Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean for backend.
- Add deployment status badges to the `README.md` for visibility.
- Set up monitoring and alerting for production deployments.

### 5. **Polish & Documentation**
- Complete all placeholder documentation in `docs/`.
- Add API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI or GraphQL schema).
- Add user and developer guides.
- Document environment variables and configuration options.
- Add architecture diagrams and data flow charts.
- Provide onboarding instructions for new contributors.
- Add a FAQ section for common issues.

### 6. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
- Write comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for both frontend and backend.
- Set up code coverage reporting.
- Add static analysis and type checking to CI.
- Perform manual QA and user acceptance testing.
- Test accessibility and responsiveness on multiple devices.

### 7. **Security & Compliance**
- Audit dependencies for vulnerabilities.
- Implement secure authentication and authorization.
- Sanitize and validate all user input.
- Ensure secure storage of secrets and sensitive data.
- Add a responsible disclosure policy (see `SECURITY.md`).

### 8. **Performance & Scalability**
- Profile and optimize frontend and backend performance.
- Implement caching strategies where appropriate.
- Plan for horizontal scaling of backend services.
- Use CDN for static assets.

### 9. **Internationalization & Localization (Optional)**
- Add support for multiple languages.
- Externalize strings and provide translation files.

## Example Steps to Complete

1. **Implement Frontend Features**
   - Build out screens and navigation in `src/app/`.
   - Implement UI components in `src/components/`.
   - Add business logic and hooks in `src/hooks/`.
   - Add accessibility and performance optimizations.

2. **Set Up Backend**
   - Create a `backend/` directory.
   - **Scaffold a backend (e.g., Express app with REST endpoints).**
     - Add a minimal Express server in `backend/server.js`.
     - Organize routes under `backend/src/routes/` (e.g., `auth.js`, `events.js`, etc.).
   - **Add database integration (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).**
     - Use Mongoose for MongoDB or Sequelize for PostgreSQL.
     - Store models in `backend/src/models/`.
   - **Implement authentication and convention data endpoints.**
     - Add endpoints for user registration/login, event data, announcements, profiles, and ticketing.
     - Use JWT for authentication.
   - **Add API documentation and tests.**
     - Document endpoints using Swagger/OpenAPI (`backend/docs/`).
     - Add unit/integration tests in `backend/tests/`.
   - **Implement security best practices.**
     - Use CORS, helmet, and input validation middleware.
     - Add rate limiting to sensitive endpoints.

3. **Connect Frontend to Backend**
   - Add API calls in frontend code.
   - Handle authentication, data fetching, and error states.
   - Use environment variables for API URLs.

4. **Testing**
   - Write unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend.
   - Set up code coverage and static analysis in CI.

5. **Deployment**
   - Deploy backend (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Azure).
   - Build and publish Expo app (App Store, Play Store, or Expo Go).
   - Document deployment steps and manage secrets securely.

6. **Documentation**
   - Update all docs and guides for users and contributors.
   - Add architecture diagrams and API references.

7. **Ongoing Maintenance**
   - Monitor for bugs and security issues.
   - Update dependencies regularly.
   - Gather user feedback and iterate on features.

## Suggestions

- **Backend:** Add a `backend/` folder with a minimal Express server and example endpoints.
- **API Integration:** Add `.env` files for API URLs.
- **Testing:** Add sample test files and scripts.
- **Assets:** Add example images and fonts to `assets/`.
- **Docs:** Expand `docs/` with architecture and API details.
- **Monitoring:** Set up logging and error tracking (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket).
- **Analytics:** Integrate analytics for usage tracking if needed.

---

**Summary:**  
The current codebase is a well-structured frontend scaffold. To make it fully runnable, you need to implement the actual app logic, add a backend/API, connect the two, and complete documentation, deployment, and ongoing maintenance.
